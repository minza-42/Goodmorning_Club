## Responsiveness

Responsiveness is achieved using:

- Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
- Media queries to adapt the design for different screen sizes
- Use of rem and percentage units for flexible sizing
- The menu transforms into an overlay on mobile and is optimized for touch

The site has been tested on both desktop and mobile to ensure it works and looks good on all devices.
