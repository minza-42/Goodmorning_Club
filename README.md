# Good Morning Club - Breakfast & Coffee

This project is a responsive breakfast and coffee menu website built as a school assignment. The design was provided as part of the assignment brief. The site is built with HTML, SCSS/CSS, and JavaScript, and features a modern, mobile-friendly layout with a custom overlay menu, styled menu lists, and a contact form.

## Features

- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Overlay navigation menu
- Menu sections for drinks (Sips), food (Grub), and news
- Custom fonts and color scheme
- Contact form with styled inputs

## Getting Started

## Responsiveness

Responsiveness is achieved using:

- Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
- Media queries to adapt the design for different screen sizes
- Use of rem and percentage units for flexible sizing
- The menu transforms into an overlay on mobile and is optimized for touch

> **Note:** Responsive design is very challenging for this project. It does not look great on mobile or iPad yet, but this is a work in progress.
